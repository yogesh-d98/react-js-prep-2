## ðŸš€ Features

- **React Router v6**: Navigation between pages using `createBrowserRouter` and `RouterProvider`.
- **Functional Components**: All components are functional, leveraging hooks.
- **Hooks**:
  - `useState` â†’ Local state management (`Counter`, `Login`).
  - `useEffect` â†’ Side effects, fetch API data, cleanup with `AbortController`.
  - `useContext` â†’ Sharing data globally (`Home` â†’ `Counter` example).
  - `useRef` â†’ Mutable values across renders (`Counter` component).
- **Dynamic Routes**: View post details with route params (`/post/:id`).
- **Error Handling**: 404 page using `Notfound` component.
- **Event Handling & Forms**: Controlled inputs, password validation, checkbox handling.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Render UI based on state or fetched data.
- **Navigation**: `Link` vs `<a>` tags for SPA-friendly routing.
- **Styling**: Bootstrap classes for cards, forms, and buttons.

ðŸ”— Routes Overview
Route	Component	Description
/	Home	Lists posts with navigation to individual posts
